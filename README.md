# Artificial Neural Network 
It is a type of deep learning model that is composed of multiple layers of interconnected nodes or neurons that process and transform input data to output predictions.
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) depending upon the human brain neuron and network functions, an artificial neural network similarly performs tasks.
